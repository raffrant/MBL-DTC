# MBL-DTC
1) Hamiltonian and calculation from Phys. Rev. B 101, 115303
The above Python code is a simple script how to be able to simulate discrete time crystals. The idea can be generalized to any Hamiltonian and any system . 
Here we study the Heisenberg spin chain taken from Phys. Rev. B 101, 115303. 

2) MBL in a tensor network package known as ITensor, written in Julia programming language. (julia file)
